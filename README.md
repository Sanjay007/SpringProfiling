<h3>
Spring Boot Profiling provides a way to segregate parts of your application configuration and make it only available in the certain environment.It is one of those concepts which we don’t use if we are working in development or just for learning purpose. Spring Boot Profiling is needed for applications which need’s to load different configurations for different environments Such as QA, DEV OR PROD.
